                years
                into NIH research funding and clinical trials.</li>
              <li>Back the Long COVID Support Act (S. 2560), TREAT Long COVID Act (HR 3258), and Long COVID

            <h2>WHY CALL?</h2>
            <p>For those who are able, calling is a very effective way to put pressure on your representative. It’s a
              proven
              strategy that shows our power. It requires their staff hours, staff attention, call logging, and
              callbacks.
            </p>

            <h2>WHO SHOULD I CALL?</h2>
            <p>Find the name and number of your Members of Congress at <a
                href="https://congress.gov/members/find-your-member" target="_blank">congress.gov/members/find-your-member</a> or call
              the
              Capitol
              Switchboard at 202-224-3121 and ask to be transferred to one of your Members of Congress.</p>

            <h2>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I CALL?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>A staffer will answer the phone.</li>
              <li>Be brief, respectful, and to the point.</li>
              <li>Be clear about your messaging. Example on the next page!</li>
              <li>If you don’t reach a live human, leave a voice message.</li>
              <li>Take your time, and don’t feel stressed!</li>
              <li>You have a right to call and voice your opinion,
                and it doesn’t have to be perfect.</li>
              <li>Your authentic voice matters.</li>
